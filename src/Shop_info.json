Thus, it has a bigger share in the jewelry industry pie. However, the market despite thousands of big, medium and small jewelers starve for high-quality equipment. In the absence of a trusted local supplier, the industry relied on imported items which were costly and required high maintenance. Understanding the need of the market for quality tools, testing equipment, and packaging material, we introduced Sachi as a reliable, reasonable and resourceful option for all the tools and accessory needs of the domestic market. Our success can be evaluated by the fact that after the introduction of our tools in the domestic market, the market share of imported tools has substantially dropped. Since all our products are made in India following our standards of quality, the products are durable, highly efficient and reasonable",
